HTTP Server
```python
for i in range(10):
    print i # yay, printing 0 - 9
```
Requests:
- [x] GET
- [ ] POST
- [ ] HEAD
- [ ] DELETE
- [ ] TRACE

Goal:
Creating all requests above (striving to create a semi-functioning HTTP server)
Secondary Goal:
Getting an HTTPS certificate (from letsencrypt.org) and have the server authenticate
