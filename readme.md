<h1>HTTP Server</h1>
```python
for i in range(10):
    print i # yay, printing 0 - 9
```
<h2>Requests:</h2>
- [x] GET
- [ ] POST
- [ ] HEAD
- [ ] DELETE
- [ ] TRACE

<h2>Goal:</h2>
Creating all requests above (striving to create a semi-functioning HTTP server)
<h2>Secondary Goal:</h2>
Getting an HTTPS certificate (from letsencrypt.org) and have the server authenticate
